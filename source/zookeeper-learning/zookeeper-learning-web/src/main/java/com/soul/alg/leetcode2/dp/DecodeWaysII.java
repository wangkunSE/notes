/**
 * A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping way:
 *
 * 'A' -> 1
 * 'B' -> 2
 * ...
 * 'Z' -> 26
 * Beyond that, now the encoded string can also contain the character '*', which can
 * be treated as one of the numbers from 1 to 9.
 *
 * Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the total number of ways to decode it.
 *
 * Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: "*"
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: The encoded message can be decoded to the string: "A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I".
 * Example 2:
 * Input: "1*"
 * Output: 9 + 9 = 18
